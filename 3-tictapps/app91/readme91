The model is not very modular.
the same object is protecting two separate types of data.
let's make a model for nextPlayer and boardState.
-  changes in controller.js, initialize, and the models directory -

|- app.html
|- controler.js
|- initialize.js
|- models/
|	|- boardModel.js
|	|- playerModel.js
|- tictactoe.css
|- view.js


this app onwards all have intersting bugs worth tracking down
