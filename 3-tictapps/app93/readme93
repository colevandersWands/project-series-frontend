two views! 
remember how the body is our frontend and the head our backend?

well, browsers start empty so it makes sense for us to have to build the board when we first initialize the app.  
from then on, it's a matter of repopulating the board

everytime the user makes a move, the 'front end' sends a request to the 
'back end'.  the 'back end' manipulates the model and redraws the 'front end'.
