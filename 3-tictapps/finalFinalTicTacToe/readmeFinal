this one's got a real callback between the controller and the board model

file structure:
|- app.html					- will be 'app.js'
|- initialize.js			- will be part of 'app.js'
|- controller.js			- will be 'routes.js'
|- models/					- will be mongo/mongoose
|  |- boardModel.js
|  |- playerModel.js
|- views/					- will be EJS files
|  |- initializeView.js
|  |- gameplayView.js
|- resources/ (or 'public')	- all static content 
   |- tictactoe.css


('app.js' and 'routes.js' can be combined into one file called 'server.js' when you're working in node)
